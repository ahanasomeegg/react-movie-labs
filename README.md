# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Duan Li

## Overview.

Firstly, I have added three more static endpoints--the NowPlaying Page, TopRated Page and Mustwatch Page. 

Secondly, I have added recommendations and credits to enrich the movie details page. The actors' names can be clicked to their own profie pages.

Thirdly, new filtering options are added.(by year and rate) 

AT last, I implemented the pagination function.

### Features.
+ MustWatch Page which can stores your must-watch movies 
+ ActorProfilePage which contains his/her moviies
+ Recommendations on the movie detail page
+ Pagination function
+ flitered by year and rate(high to low, low to high)

## Setup requirements.

There is no non-standard requirements to set up. Just follow the normal steps.

## API endpoints.

[ List the __additional__ TMDB endpoints used, giving the description and pathname for each one.] 

e.g.
+ Discover list of upcoming movies - movie/upcoming
+ Discover list of now_playing movies - movie/now_playing
+ Discover list of top rated movies - movie/top_rated
+ Get movie recommendations - movie/${id}/recommendations
+ Get movie credits - movie/${id}/credits
+ Get actor details - person/${id}
+ Get actor movies - getActorMovies
## Routing.

[ List the __new routes__ supported by your app and state the associated page.]

+ /blogs - displays all published blogs.
+ /blogs/:id - displays a particular blog.
+ /blogs/:id/comments - detail view of a particular blog and its comments.
+ etc.

[If relevant, state what aspects of your app are protected (i.e. require authentication) and what is public.]

## Independent learning (If relevant).

Itemize the technologies/techniques you researched independently and adopted in your project, 
i.e. aspects not covered in the lectures/labs. Include the source code filenames that illustrate these 
(we do not require code excerpts) and provide references to the online resources that helped you (articles/blogs).
